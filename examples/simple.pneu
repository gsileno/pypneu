/*
Non-deterministic System Test
Scenario: One producer, two competing consumers
*/

// 1. Initial State: 1 token in 'ready'
ready.

// 2. Production: consumes 'ready', produces 'buffer'
ready -> #produce -> buffer.

// 3. Conflict: #path_a and #path_b both compete for the same 'buffer' token.
buffer -> #path_a -> received_a.
buffer -> #path_b -> received_b.

// 4. Reset: Cleanup for next cycle (if tokens were available)
received_a, received_b -> #reset -> ready.
